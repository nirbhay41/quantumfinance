The elephant in the room in any discussion of art collecting today is the way that "non-fungible tokens" (NFTs) have burst onto the scene, especially since a work of art by Mike Winkelmann, who goes by the name Beeple, sold for $69.3 million at Christieâ€™s in March and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey sold his first ever tweet as an NFT for more than $2.9 million.

These works leverage blockchain technology to create an NFT which acts as a digital certificate for the work of art.

We are artists who want to do the work and produce art in order to make a living from our art. We put community building, product market fit and personal growth above all else. We wont judge you based on which school you attended, which gallery shows your work or which billionaire parks his equity in your art.

Our goal is to help artists get easily onboarded and gain access into the vast world of NFT media. We offer a turnkey NFT minting service where we help artists bring their valuable art into the world of crypto as an NFT.

We will cover all the costs (gas fees) associated with minting your NFTs. We also provide the infrastructure, marketing and guidance for launching your NFT art as well as a professional network to help artists to connect, collaborate , showcase and monetize their art.
