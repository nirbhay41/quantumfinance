      <description>The elephant in the room in any discussion of art collecting today is the way that &amp;ldquo;non-fungible tokens&amp;rdquo; (NFTs) have burst onto the scene, especially since a work of art by Mike Winkelmann, who goes by the name Beeple, sold for $69.3 million at Christie’s in March and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey sold his first ever tweet as an NFT for more than $2.9 million.
These works leverage blockchain technology to create an NFT which acts as a digital certificate for the work of art.</description>
